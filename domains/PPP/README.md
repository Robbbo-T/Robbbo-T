# Domain PPP - Propulsion, Performance, Production

This domain covers the final "P" triad:
- **Propulsion**: Power generation and thrust systems
- **Performance**: Aircraft/spacecraft performance analysis
- **Production**: Manufacturing and industrialization

---

## Scope

### Propulsion
- H₂ fuel cells (Air)
- Turbogenerators (Air backup/peak)
- E-fans (Air distributed propulsion)
- Rocket engines (Space)
- Electric motors and controllers
- Power distribution

### Performance
- Mission analysis (range, payload, energy)
- Climb/cruise/descent optimization
- Trajectory optimization (Space)
- Efficiency metrics (energy per pax-km)
- Environmental performance (CO₂, NOx, noise)

### Production
- Manufacturing processes
- Supply chain
- Industrialization roadmap
- Cost modeling
- Rate ramp-up planning

---

## Cross-Product Synergies

- Electric propulsion technology sharing (Air e-fans ↔ Space RCS thrusters)
- H₂ propulsion (Air fuel cells ↔ Space H₂/O₂ engines)
- Production methods (composites, additive manufacturing)

---

## Key Metrics

### Air (AMPEL360-T-Air)
- E-fan efficiency: Target >90%
- Fuel cell specific power: Target >1.5 kW/kg
- Energy per pax-km: Target 40% reduction vs conventional

### Space (AMPEL360-T-Space)
- ISP (specific impulse): Depends on propellant choice
- Mass fraction: Target >0.85
- Reusability: Target >50 flights
