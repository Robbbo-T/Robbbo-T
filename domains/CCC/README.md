# Domain CCC - Certification, Compliance, Configuration

This domain ensures regulatory compliance and configuration control:
- **Certification**: Paths to certification (EASA, ESA, NASA)
- **Compliance**: Meeting all applicable standards
- **Configuration**: Change control and version management

---

## Scope

### Certification
- Identify applicable regulations (CS-25, ECSS, HRP)
- Special Conditions development (H₂, electric, BWB)
- Means of Compliance (MoC)
- Safety cases and assessments
- Authority coordination (EASA, ESA, NASA, national)

### Compliance
- Compliance matrices (requirement → evidence)
- Verification and validation
- Documentation packages (PDR, CDR, certification docs)
- Audit trails and traceability

### Configuration
- Change control process
- Version management
- Interface control
- Baseline management
- Release procedures

## Cross-Product Application

Both Air and Space follow similar patterns:
- Requirements traceability
- Safety assessment methods (FMEA, FTA, FHA)
- Configuration management

But different standards:
- **Air**: EASA CS-25 + Special Conditions
- **Space**: ESA ECSS, NASA standards, human-rating

## Key Deliverables

- Certification plans (per product)
- Compliance matrices
- MoC (Means of Compliance) documents
- Safety assessment reports
- Configuration management plan
