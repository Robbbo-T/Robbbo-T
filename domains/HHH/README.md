# Domain HHH - Human Factors, Hydrogen, HUMS

This domain covers three critical H areas:
- **Human Factors**: Ergonomics, crew/pax experience, safety
- **Hydrogen**: H₂ systems, criogenia, safety
- **HUMS**: Health & Usage Monitoring Systems

---

## Scope

### Human Factors
- Cabin design and ergonomics
- HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
- G-load tolerance (especially Space)
- Emergency procedures and crew training
- Accessibility requirements

### Hydrogen
- LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) storage and handling
- Criogenic systems design
- H₂ safety (leak detection, ventilation)
- Refueling procedures
- BOG (Boil-Off Gas) management

### HUMS
- Structural health monitoring
- Engine/motor health monitoring
- Predictive maintenance
- Data acquisition and analysis
- ML/AI for anomaly detection

## Cross-Product Synergies

Both Air and Space products benefit from:
- Shared H₂ safety standards
- Common HUMS architectures
- Human factors research (G-loads, displays)

---

## Key Standards

- **Human Factors**: CS-25 cabin safety, ESA human factors handbooks
- **Hydrogen**: ISO/TR 15916, SAE AIR7854 (H₂ aircraft)
- **HUMS**: ATA Spec 2000, IEEE 1232
